## Overview
The Stock Market Predictor is a machine learning project that aims to predict the future prices of stocks, such as those in the S&P 500 index. By leveraging historical stock data, this predictor utilizes advanced neural network techniques to model and forecast stock price trends.

## Core Concepts
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: RNNs are a class of neural networks that excel at processing sequential data, such as time series. In this project, RNNs, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, are used to capture temporal dependencies in stock price data, allowing for more accurate predictions of future stock movements.
- **Time Series Forecasting**: This project focuses on the analysis and prediction of time series data, which in this case is the historical stock prices.
- **Data Normalization**: Ensuring that data is on a comparable scale to improve the performance and stability of the neural network.

## Languages, Libraries, and Dependencies
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for this project.
- **TensorFlow**: A powerful deep learning library used to build and train the RNN model.
- **Streamlit**: A framework used to create an interactive web application that allows users to input stock symbols and see predictions.
- **scikit-learn**: A machine learning library used for data preprocessing, including the MinMaxScaler for normalizing stock data.
